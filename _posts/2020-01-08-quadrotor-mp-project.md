We built a simulation from scratch and implemented several path planning algorithms to find a path through an obstacle course. Then we simulated a quadrotor drone to execute this trajectory.

abstract:
> In this report we present a comparison between RRT, RRT* and Informed-RRT* path planners in $R^3$ for a general quad-rotor. We compare their runtime performance and optimal path cost in two unique environments. We introduce kinodynamic constraints to prevent collisions and evaluate their impact on runtime performance.
