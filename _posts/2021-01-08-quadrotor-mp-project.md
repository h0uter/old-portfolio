In this report we present a comparison between RRT, RRT* and Informed-RRT* path planners in $R^3$ for a general quad-rotor. We compare their runtime performance and optimal path cost in two unique environments. We introduce kinodynamic constraints to prevent collisions and evaluate their impact on runtime performance.

<!-- In short: we built a simulation from the ground up in Python and then implemented RRT and RRT* path planning algorithms to find a path through an obstacle course. Then we simulated a quadrotor to execute this trajectory with a PID controller and chase mode. -->
