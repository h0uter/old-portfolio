Train classical and Deep Learning methods for the purpose of picking up cutlery with a small robot.
To this end we setup a complete machine learning pipeline.

You can check out the published notebook online @ https://deepnote.com/publish/452790e4-76c0-49f0-8fb0-80760653c8f0

Additionaly, you can execute our code in the cloud at: https://deepnote.com/project/452790e4-76c0-49f0-8fb0-80760653c8f0


Worked together on this project with Wesley who made a post about our success:
