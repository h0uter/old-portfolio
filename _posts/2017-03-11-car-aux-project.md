Me and my brother share our grandmas old car, it's a beautiful Renault Megaine from 1998. However we wanted to listen to our own music, but the car only supported radio or cassette. So a new projects was born.

I removed the car radio from its socket to inspect the model type. A search on google bought me to the manual, luckily back in the day companies still provide electronic schematics for their products.

Inspecting the schematics allowed be to identify the cassette amplifier.
So I soldered in an 3.5mm female port parallel to the cassette input.
This ensured the 3.5mm output from my phone would be properly amplified before it's sent to car the speakers.

## Update 2021
The custom AUX port is still going strong and has allowed me and my brother to listen to many hours of music and podcasts.
