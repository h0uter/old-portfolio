Me and my brother share our grandmas old car, it's a beautiful Renault MÃ©gane 2.0 from 1998. However we wanted to listen to our own music, unfortunately the car only supported radio or cassette. So a new projects was conceived.

I removed the car radio from its socket to inspect the model type. A search on google bought me to the manual, luckily back in the day companies still provide in-depth electronic schematics for their products.

Inspecting the schematics allowed be to identify the cassette amplifier.

So I soldered in an 3.5mm female port parallel to the cassette input.
This ensured the 3.5mm output from my phone would be properly amplified before it's sent to car the speakers.

## Update 2021
The custom AUX port is still going strong and has allowed me and my brother to listen to many hours of music and podcasts.
