## Current projects

### Quadrotor motion planning

### LIDAR sensor fusion for intelligent vehicles

## Previous projects

### Machine learning for pen pose estimation
Train classical and Deep Learning methods for the purpose of picking up cutlery with a small robot.

Worked together on this project with Wesley who made a post about our succes:

### pcl and OpenCV Intelligent vehicle implementation in ROS
Using pcl I implemented plane segmentation and pedestrian detection using LIDAR sensor as input. My partner used OpenCV to detect the road boundaries and keep the car on the road.
