Hi thanks for visiting, my portfolio site is currently a work in progress. Below I've listed some of my projects

## Current projects 

### Quadrotor motion planning

Our goal is to implement a path planning algorithm to steer the drone through an obstacle course. I'm currently working on the drone controller.

### Perception for intelligent vehicles

LIDAR sensor fusion kickoff is next week. Before that I worked on implementing a Lalman filter to track and predict the movements of pedestrians. Additionally we work on using a particle filter to localize a robot in a known map.

## Previous projects 

### Machine learning for pen pose estimation
Train classical and Deep Learning methods for the purpose of picking up cutlery with a small robot.

Worked together on this project with Wesley who made a post about our success:

### Meta learning deep learning reproduction project

> Humans are adept at solving tasks under many different conditions. This is partly due to fast adaptation, but also due to a lifetime of encountering new task conditions. This provides the opportunity to develop strategies, which are robust to different task contexts.
>
> We would like artificial learning agents to do the same because this would make them much more versatile and perform better â€˜out-the-boxâ€™

We wrote a blogpost detailing our reproduction efforts.

### Stabilizing a double pendulum 
 Learned to apply several different control strategies to stabilize a double  pendulum in various positions on a physical setup.

### pcl and OpenCV implementation in ROS
The goal was to make an intelligent vehicle complete an obstacle course. Using pcl I implemented plane segmentation and pedestrian detection using LIDAR sensor as input. My partner used OpenCV to detect the road boundaries and keep the car on the road.
