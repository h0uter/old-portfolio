I am currently a Mechanical Engineering PhD candidate at the University of Washington, co-advised by [Steve Brunton](https://www.eigensteve.com/) and [Nathan Kutz](http://faculty.washington.edu/kutz/).

My work focuses on developing methods to improve reduced order models for systems with underlying symmetries. I have developed an unsupervised, optimization-based method for improving dimensionality reduction methods when translations are present in the data. I have applied the method to example problems and experimental data taken from a rotating detonation engine. In the future, I endeavor to extend this method to higher dimensions. Additionally, I want to expand this work to include other symmetries such as rotations and scaling to apply to a wider class of problems.
