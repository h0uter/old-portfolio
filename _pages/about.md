Hi👋 Welcome to my academic site. Its a WIP

I live by the words: "time waits for noone"

I am currently a MSc. student Signals and systems working on my Thesis at Bang&Olufsun in Denmark. I am being supervised by Jorge Martinez and Martin ...

My current research focus is room geometry detection using a combination of Acoustics and LiDAR.

My General research interest include sensing and imaging with all modalities excluding radar.

Next to my studies I'm a hardcore gamer girl🕹 and gym dog🤸‍♀️.
