# The Problem
Intercompany collaboration is becoming increasingly important. However, these collaborations often take place between companies of the same size: in an incubator startups work together and innovation networks mostly include larger companies. The linking of small, innovative startups together with larger companies could yield significant innovative results for both parties.

Besides this, we have noticed that the highest demand in coworking spaces is not for single seats, but rather for small offices that are rented on a monthly basis. There are long waiting lists for startups and small businesses seeking to join these office spaces. These same users mention that a big aspect in choosing which coworking space to go to, is the type of other people and businesses that work there. 

## An Elegant Solution
We provide a platform with which companies can rent out their surplus office space to startups requiring a place to work, but lacking the budget to rent or buy their own office. This opens up mutually beneficial collaboration opportunities for both involved parties. 

Eventually this will develop into a platform on which everyone with our app can rent out available working space, either via a coworking concept or as a fixed workplace. Additionally, the platform would serve as matchmaker between both established companies and startups in their search to maximize office space utilization.
