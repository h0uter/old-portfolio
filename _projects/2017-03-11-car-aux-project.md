Me and my brother share our grandmas old car, it's a beautiful Renault MÃ©gane 2.0 from 1998. However we wanted to listen to our own music, unfortunately the car only supported radio or cassette. So a new projects was conceived.

I removed the car radio from its socket to inspect the model type. A search on google bought me to the manual, luckily back in the day companies still provide in-depth electronic schematics for their products.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/2017-03-11-car-aux-project/car-aux-diagram-min.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>

Inspecting the schematics allowed be to identify the cassette amplifier.

    The red and blue wires are the L and R channel soldered into the cassete amplifier. The black wire is the grounding.

So I soldered in an 3.5mm female port parallel to the cassette input.
This ensured the 3.5mm output from my phone would be properly amplified before it's sent to car the speakers.

## Update 2021
The custom AUX port is still going strong and has allowed me and my brother to listen to many hours of music and podcasts.
